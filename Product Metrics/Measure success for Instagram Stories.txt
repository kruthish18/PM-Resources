How would you measure the success of Instagram Stories?


1. Define the Goals of Instagram Stories: Begin by establishing the primary goals of Instagram Stories to frame your response. Instagram Stories are designed to increase daily user engagement, encourage content sharing, and keep users connected to their social circles in a more real-time, informal way. For Instagram as a platform, Stories also serve as a tool to drive advertising revenue and keep users engaged longer on the platform.

Example: “Instagram Stories are meant to encourage more frequent and casual content sharing, increasing user engagement on a daily basis, while providing Instagram with opportunities to monetize through ads between Stories.”

2. Identify Key Success Metrics (KPIs):

Engagement Metrics:
Daily Active Users (DAUs): One of the most important indicators of success for Stories is how often users are engaging with it daily. You would track the number of users who are either viewing or posting Stories daily.
Story Views: Measure the average number of views each Story gets, which can be broken down by categories like friends, influencers, or businesses.
Completion Rate: Track how many users watch an entire Story from beginning to end. A high completion rate indicates engaging content.
Interaction Rate: Measure interactions such as replies, direct messages, or sticker interactions (polls, questions, etc.) within a Story. High interaction rates indicate that Stories are prompting users to engage rather than passively consume content.
Reposting Rate: Track how often users share other people’s Stories, indicating how valuable or entertaining they find the content.

Creation Metrics:
Story Creators: Track how many users are actively creating Stories on a regular basis. A growing number of creators indicates that users find the tool easy and worthwhile to use.
Story Frequency: Measure how often users post Stories. This helps gauge whether Stories are contributing to more frequent user activity on the platform.


Retention and Growth Metrics:

Repeat Usage: Measure how many users return to use or view Stories regularly, indicating that Stories are becoming part of their habitual Instagram usage.
User Growth: Track whether the introduction or improvement of Stories is leading to an increase in new users or a reactivation of dormant users.

Content Quality Metrics:

Story Length: Track how long users’ Stories are on average and how often users post the maximum allowable number of slides (which could signal a strong content pipeline).
Use of Features: Measure how often users utilize interactive features like stickers, polls, GIFs, or music in their Stories. A high usage rate indicates that these tools are adding value to the content creation process.

Business and Monetization Metrics:

Story Ads Performance: For advertisers, success can be measured by the performance of ads inserted between Stories. Metrics like click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, and cost per mille (CPM) will indicate the effectiveness of these ads.
Ad Revenue from Stories: Track the total revenue generated by ads in Stories. Growth in this metric would signal that Stories are becoming an increasingly valuable ad placement for Instagram.

3. Qualitative Metrics:
User Satisfaction and Feedback: Gather user feedback about the Stories feature through surveys or in-app feedback mechanisms. Questions could focus on ease of use, the variety of features, and overall satisfaction.
NPS for Stories: Measure how likely users are to recommend Instagram Stories to their friends, as a proxy for satisfaction and feature delight.

4. Competitive Benchmarking:
Time Spent on Stories vs. Competitors: Compare Instagram Stories’ performance with similar features on competing platforms (e.g., Snapchat, TikTok). If users are spending more time on Instagram Stories, it indicates competitive success.


5. Conclusion: Tie everything back to Instagram’s overall goals. A successful Instagram Stories feature will drive daily engagement, content sharing, and time spent on the platform, while also contributing significantly to Instagram's ad revenue. Emphasize that a combination of these KPIs, not just one, will give a holistic view of success.
Example: "To measure the success of Instagram Stories, we would focus on a blend of engagement metrics like daily active users and interaction rates, creation metrics like the frequency of Story posting, and business outcomes like ad performance. Ultimately, these metrics help gauge how well Stories are keeping users engaged with the platform and contributing to Instagram's business goals through advertising."
